# Yoga Asanas XML project

This project provides an XML document featuring a list of yoga asanas along with their descriptions, structured and styled for dsiplay using XML and CSS. thr purpose is to apply XML knowlegde in a practical scenario, using Visual Studio Code and various tools to manage XML files.

## Why I did this

The Yoga Asanas project was created as a direct application of the XML concepts learned in a recent educational session. The project serves multiple purposes:
- **Practical Application**: To apply theoretical XML knowledge by creating a structured XML document.
- **Learning Tool**: As a means to deepen understanding of XML syntax and best practices.
- **Utility**: To create a visually appealing and useful reference for Yoga practitioners and instructors.

## What I Learned

From the lecture and the subsequent project development, I gained insights into:
- **XML Syntax**: Understanding the fundamentals of XML, including elements, attributes, and the importance of well-formed XML.
- **CSS Integration**: How to use CSS to style XML data for presentation purposes, enhancing the readability and accessibility of XML data in a web browser.
- **XML Tools**: Utilizing tools within Visual Studio Code, specifically the XML extension by Red Hat, to efficiently create and manage XML documents.
- **Problem-Solving**: Debugging issues related to XML file structure and CSS styling, such as dealing with caching issues and ensuring correct pathnames for linked resources.


## Project Structure

- `YogaAsanas.xml`: The main XML file containing structured data about Yoga Asanas.
- `YogaStyles.css`: The CSS file that styles the XML data when viewed in a web browser.

## Viewing the XML in a Browser

To view the styled XML document:
1. Open the `YogaAsanas.xml` file in a web browser that supports XML and CSS (e.g., Firefox or Chrome).
2. Ensure that `YogaStyles.css` is in the same directory as the XML file and is correctly linked in the XML.

## Editing the XML

To modify or add new Asanas:
1. Open `YogaAsanas.xml` in a text or XML editor.
2. Follow the existing structure to add or modify Asanas, ensuring each entry has a unique `id`.

## Editing the CSS

To change the styling:
1. Open `YogaStyles.css` in any text editor.
2. Adjust the CSS properties to change the appearance of the XML presentation in the browser.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by adding new Asanas, improving the CSS, or translating the content into other languages.
